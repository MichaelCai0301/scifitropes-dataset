Movie / TV Show Name,Year,Rating,Categories,Quote,Description
2001: A Space Odyssey,1968,8.3,"space, ai, singularity","Cinematically, this movie is a masterpiece. This is one of the few films on this list that is important as a film in itself, not just to the genre. From the beginning to the end, it is captivating - if you don't mind a bit of a slower pace than most of the other films on here.","Humanity finds a mysterious, obviously artificial, object buried beneath the Lunar surface and, with the intelligent computer H.A.L. 9000, sets off on a quest."
A Clockwork Orange,1971,8.4,dystopia,,"In future Britain, charismatic delinquent Alex DeLarge is jailed and volunteers for an experimental aversion therapy developed by the government in an effort to solve society's crime problem—but not all goes according to plan."

Psychologically horrifying in more than a few ways.","A secret military project endangers Neo-Tokyo when it turns a biker gang member into a rampaging psionic psychopath that only two kids and a group of psionics can stop."
Arrival,2016,8.3,"aliens, linguistics","A beautiful film, weaving together memory, languages, and the other. The film is less about aliens and more about our perception of them; like District 9, this film functions as a good mirror for how different people and governments deal with alien interaction. The music is also exceptional.","When 12 mysterious spacecraft appear around the world, linguistics professor Louise Banks is tasked with interpreting the language of the apparent alien visitors."
Blade Runner,1982,8.2,"dystopia, ai, cyberpunk, singularity","Very few films can stand up to as many rewatches as this film can - there are layers upon layers, and the bleak image of the future hasn't lost its power in the thirty years the film has been around. This was a reworking of the Phillip K. Dick book (above), but without a lot of unnecessary or largely spurious subplots, and it focuses much more on identity, sexuality, and the psychological ramifications of technology. A masterpiece.","A blade runner must pursue and try to terminate four replicants who stole a ship in space and have returned to Earth to find their creator."
Blade Runner 2049,2017,8.0,"dystopia, ai, cyberpunk, thriller, mystery","Blade Runner 2049 returns to the original book's deep philosophical questions about the nature of humanity, and expressed through a captivating, epic mystery it amounts to a breathtaking, mind-bending cinematic experience.","A young blade runner's discovery of a long-buried secret leads him to track down former blade runner Rick Deckard, who's been missing for thirty years."
Brazil,1985,8.0,"dystopia, police","If you're looking to replicate the experience of taking acid without actually doing drugs, than this film is for you. Weird as hell, and De Niro's cameo is strange, but this film is very good.","A bureaucrat in a retro-future world tries to correct an administrative error and himself becomes an enemy of the state."
Cargo,2009,6.2,"space, dystopia","Why not try something out of the ordinary with this Swiss sci-fi thriller?","In 2270, Earth is completely depleted and no one lives there anymore. Those that have money move to Rhea; but most of the population lives in orbit in space stations. Dr. Laura Portmann decides to work in the cargo ship Kassandra in an eight year travel to Station 42 that is in orbit of RH278 to raise money to meet her sister Arianne in Rhea."
Chappie,2015,7.1,"ai, police","A movie about an AI robot ""growing up"" (as in, learning about the world and learning the difference between good and bad). An amazing story, you really feel like Chappie is your friend by the end of the movie. Visual effects are not that great in a couple of scenes.","In the near future, crime is patrolled by a mechanized police force. When one police droid, Chappie, is stolen and given new programming, he becomes the first robot with the ability to think and feel for himself."
Children of Men,2006,7.9,"dystopia, drama","Imagine a world where no baby has been born for 18 years because of the global human infertility. Think which kinds of consequences would that bring. Then, imagine a girl getting pregnant in that kind of world. This movie is absolutely fantastic! The action shots are magnificent. I rewatched it tonight and the movie gave me the same kind of goosebumps it did when I first watched it a couple of years ago. I have no compaints about this movie. It's the perfect way to spend two hours. It gets 10/10 from me.","In 2027, in a chaotic world in which women have become somehow infertile, a former activist agrees to help transport a miraculously pregnant woman to a sanctuary at sea."
Cloud Atlas,2012,7.5,"drama, thriller","This is an awesome movie. It is a deep movie, with a complex plot. You don't want to be distracted while watching it. I liked how the six different stories played by different characters are played by the same actors and how the stories can be different but are linked by small things. Also, if you like non standard narratives this is your movie.","An exploration of how the actions of individual lives impact one another in the past, present and future, as one soul is shaped from a killer into a hero, and an act of kindness ripples across centuries to inspire a revolution."
Coherence,2013,7.1,,,"Strange things begin to happen when a group of friends gather for a dinner party on an evening when a comet is passing overhead."
Contact,1997,7.4,"aliens, space, drama, mystery, thriller","Based on a novel by the fantastic Carl Sagan, this is a painstakingly realistic piece of sci-fi art.","Dr. Ellie Arroway, after years of searching, finds conclusive radio proof of extraterrestrial intelligence, sending plans for a mysterious machine."
Dark City,1998,7.7,"aliens, mystery, sci-fi, thriller","Excellent neo-noir about a man trapped in a city permanently in nighttime. He suffers from amnesia, and he may or may not have killed several women. Both the police and a group of men called the Strangers are hot on his trail. I love the 1940s sci-fi setting and the plot full of mysteries.","A man struggles with memories of his past, including a wife he cannot remember, in a nightmarish world with no sun."
District 9,2009,8.0,"aliens, thriller, apartheid","I thought it was pretty awesome, even just linguistically. Special effects were great. Interesting given it was South African, too.","An extraterrestrial race forced to live in slum-like conditions on Earth suddenly finds a kindred spirit in a government agent who is exposed to their biotechnology."
Dune,1984,6.6,"space, aliens","This is based on the Dune book by Herbert, listed above. This version is legendary - it has Patrick Stewart and Sting as actors, and David Lynch's direction is weird and weighty. The soundtrack, by Toto, is good enough to stand on its own. I can't imagine reading the books without thinking of this viewing.","A Duke's son leads desert warriors against the galactic emperor and his father's evil nemesis when they assassinate his father and free their desert world from the emperor's rule."
Edge of Tomorrow,2014,7.9,"thriller, police, aliens","Thrilling and original. Feels like a cross between Halo (the game), Groundhog Day and The Butterfly Effect.","A military officer is brought into an alien war against an extraterrestrial enemy who can reset the day and know the future. When this officer is enabled with the same power, he teams up with a Special Forces warrior to try and end the war."

Europa Report,2013,6.5,space,,"An international crew of astronauts undertakes a privately funded mission to search for life on Jupiter's fourth largest moon."
Ex Machina,2015,7.9,ai,"Thought-provoking movie that explores what it means to be human. Deep, suspenseful, and at times claustrophobic. Acting is to perfection. Visual effects are so well done and natural you don't even notice them. Truly the best sci-fi movie I've watched in years.","A young programmer is selected to participate in a breakthrough experiment in artificial intelligence by evaluating the human qualities of a breathtaking female A.I."
eXistenZ,1999,6.8,thriller,"This is an independent movie, their budget wasn't very good and thus maybe the shots and the special effects are not the best, but it has all the good elements of a scifi movie and a thriller. I liked all the details about how the perfect virtual reality devices work and what the users feel when in game.","A game designer on the run from assassins must play her latest virtual reality creation with a marketing trainee to determine if the game has been damaged."
Forbidden Planet,1956,7.6,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","Forbidden Planet is one of, if not the most iconic Science Fiction movie to have have been released during the 1950's. It stands shoulder to shoulder with the likes of ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" and ""The Invasion of the Body Snatchers"".","A starship crew goes to investigate the silence of a planet's colony only to find two survivors and a deadly secret that one of them has."
Galaxy Quest,1999,7.3,"comedy, space, aliens","If you've heard of Star Trek, and like comedy, this is for you - the entire film is a giant joke on the scifi industry, played by fantastic actors. Hilarious.","The alumni cast of a space opera television series have to play their roles as the real thing when an alien race needs their help."
Gattaca,1997,7.8,"biopunk, space","This film gets more relevant every year. Slow at times, the questions it raises are especially pertinent as your data becomes more important to insurance companies and governments, and as Western culture is increasingly becoming aware of genetic advantages and privilege.","A genetically inferior man assumes the identity of a superior one in order to pursue his lifelong dream of space travel."
Ghost in the Shell,1995,8.0,"anime, ai, police",,"A female cyborg cop and her partner hunt a mysterious and powerful hacker called the Puppet Master."
Godzilla,1954,7.5,"apocalypse, aliens, action",,"American nuclear weapons testing results in the creation of a seemingly unstoppable, dinosaur-like beast."
Hackers,1995,6.2,"cyberpunk, police, thriller","In a strange loop, a lot of the statements made in this film about who hackers are have gone full circle and been incorporated into our culture (Substack's ending most of his slides with 'Hack the planet', for instance). The actual hacking is ridiculous, but the punks on the edge of society coming into their own makes this worth watching.","A young boy is arrested by the U.S. Secret Service for writing a computer virus and is banned from using a computer until his 18th birthday. Years later, he and his new-found friends discover a plot to unleash a dangerous computer virus, but they must use their computer skills to find the evidence while being pursued by the Secret Service and the evil computer genius behind the virus."
Her,2014,8.0,"ai, drama, singularity","Hey, lets all fall in love in our operating systems! The movie seems like a plausible love story and it takes the reality of our addiction to technology to a whole new level.","A lonely writer develops an unlikely relationship with his newly purchased operating system that's designed to meet his every need."
I Origins,2014,7.3,cyberpunk,,"A molecular biologist and his laboratory partner uncover evidence that may fundamentally change society as we know it."
"I, Robot",2004,7.1,"ia, crime","The name of this movie comes from the Asimov's book of the same name, which consists of science fiction short stories. The movie could perfectly be another of Asimov's stories. It mimics his style and shows an interesting movie posing questions about artificial intelligence, conscience and emotion.","In 2035, a technophobic cop investigates a crime that may have been perpetrated by a robot, which leads to a larger threat to humanity."
Inception,2010,8.8,cyberpunk,"A major blockbuster, this film stretches the limits of recursion while maintaining its action. Well acted and beautifully shot.","A thief who steals corporate secrets through use of dream-sharing technology is given the inverse task of planting an idea into the mind of a CEO."
Interstellar,2014,8.7,space,"An interesting (and long) movie about a humanity trying to safe itself by leaving Earth after a huge climate change that made it difficult to grow food. Truly remarkable story and amazing graphic.","A team of explorers travel through a wormhole in an attempt to ensure humanity's survival."
La Jetée,1962,8.4,"time travel, drama","This film inspired Twelve Monkeys, but is more notable for being one of the earliest short scifi films that deals with time travel and its ramifications for revolutions and society as a whole. Black and white and beautiful.","Time travel, still images, a past, present and future and the aftermath of World War III. The tale of a man, a slave, sent back and forth, in and out of time, to find a solution to the world's fate. To replenish its decreasing stocks of food, medicine and energies, and in doing so, resulting in a perpetual memory of a lone female, life, death and past events that are recreated on an airports jetée."
Metropolis,1927,8.3,apocalypse,"This is the kind of film that sells out art houses when someone finds an early roll of the film in a theatre in Buenos Aires, stacked away behind decades of other movies. Seminal in its ability to show a technological future when we were just beginning to understand what that would look like, this film is a masterpiece of class statements, and is much braver at times than a lot of modern, 'edgy' scripts.","In a futuristic city sharply divided between the working class and the city planners, the son of the city's mastermind falls in love with a working class prophet who predicts the coming of a savior to mediate their differences."
Minority Report,2002,7.7,"ai, police","Predicting future crimes? Sure, I am all for it, _until_ they make a mistake and implicate the hero himself. After watching the movie, you could be thinking, _we_ should probably not try to predict the future! Nevertheless, great movie!","In a future where a special police unit is able to arrest murderers before they commit their crimes, an officer from that unit is himself accused of a future murder."
Moon,2009,8.0,"space, drama","This is one of the best drawn-out psychodrama films about space out there, along with 2001: A Space Odyssey and Solaris. Sam Bell is pretty much the only actor in the film, and his lonely acting makes you feel the loneliness of isolation. This film is also fantastic for its powerful score.","Astronaut Sam Bell has a quintessentially personal encounter toward the end of his three-year stint on the Moon, where he, working alongside his computer, GERTY, sends back to Earth parcels of a resource that has helped diminish our planet's power problems."
Mr. Nobody,2009,7.9,"drama, romance","This is one of my favourite movies. A myriad of stories are told: the different ramifications of how Mr. Nobody's life would have been if he had made different choices or if different things happened around him. What's best of this movie is that each of these **lifes** is completely different (and **would have been equally meaningful** :D) which means a lot of stuff is happening all the time and you have to follow what is going on now in this life, how it relates to its past which is probably another life shown in the movie and it's the common past of several of the lives you'll see. At the same time you have to understand the common theme of the movie, which I think it is what is trying to communicate after all. The end is surprising and difficult to grasp at first. The film also makes substantial use of chaos theory and the butterfly effect to accentuate the lack of control that humanity as individuals possesses","A boy stands on a station platform as a train is about to leave. Should he go with his mother or stay with his father? Infinite possibilities arise from this decision. As long as he doesn't choose, anything is possible."
Oblivion,2013,7.0,apocalypse,"A post-apocalyptic movie, starring Tom Cruise as Jack Harper (Tech 49) and Andrea Riseborough as Victoria (Vica). Jack has a lot of questions, Vica shrugs them off, and then, they get answered and Jack can barely live with it! Beuatifully shot!","A veteran assigned to extract Earth's remaining resources begins to question what he knows about his mission and himself."
Open Your Eyes,1997,7.8,"drama, romance","The original spanish movie [Vanilla Sky](#vanilla-sky-2001-69) was based on, way better acting, you should watch this first.","A very handsome man finds the love of his life, but he suffers an accident and needs to have his face rebuilt by surgery after it is severely disfigured."
Paprika,2006,7.7,ai,,"When a machine that allows therapists to enter their patients' dreams is stolen, all hell breaks loose. Only a young female therapist can stop it: Paprika."
Possible Worlds,2000,6.9,"philosophy, drama","This is an extraordinary film that manages to give an expose of possible worlds without ending with a completely deranged plot. It is well done, and the mystery and romance of the characters involved adds to the constanct feeling of apprehension. Which reality is the viewer in? Also, Tilda Swinton is great in this.","A man lives in parallel worlds, falling in love with the same woman, while the police hunt down a serial killer who steals brains."
Predestination,2014,7.5,time travel,,"The life of a time-traveling Temporal Agent. On his final assignment, he must pursue the one criminal that has eluded him throughout time."
Primer,2004,7.0,,,"Four friends/fledgling entrepreneurs, knowing that there's something bigger and more innovative than the different error-checking devices they've built, wrestle over their new invention."
Screamers,1995,6.3,"apocalyptic, artificial intelligence, space","A thrilling ride that expertly blends suspense with thought-provoking themes about technology and warfare. If you enjoy films that challenge your perceptions of humanity and technology, this is definitely one to watch!","A military commander stationed off planet during an interplanetary war travels through the devastated landscape to negotiate a peace treaty, but discovers that the primitive robots they built to kill enemy combatants have gained sentience."
Serenity (Firefly),2005,8.0,"space, western, action","Watch the Firefly series before seeing this film. It is good in itself, for the special effects if nothing else, but it wraps up and solidifies a lot of things that the cancelled show left open, to the equal chagrin and joy of its fanatic fanbase.","The crew of the ship Serenity tries to evade an assassin sent to recapture one of their number who is telepathic."
Snowpiercer,2013,7.0,"apocalypse, action",,"Set in a future where a failed climate-change experiment kills all life on the planet except for a lucky few who boarded the Snowpiercer, a train that travels around the globe, where a class system emerges."
Solaris,1972,8.1,"space, drama","This is the original film based on the book. It is much slower than the remake, but a classic.","A psychologist is sent to a station orbiting a distant planet in order to discover what has caused the crew to go insane."
Solaris,2002,6.2,"space, drama","Starring George Clooney and Natasha McElhone, this is much more of a modern psychodrama with fantastic shots and a more colored atmosphere than the original film. The original score by Cliff Martinez really adds to the film, and is great on its own. One of my favorite films.","A troubled psychologist is sent to investigate the crew of an isolated research station orbiting a bizarre planet."
Source Code,2011,7.5,"ai, action",,"A soldier wakes up in someone else's body and discovers he's part of an experimental government program to find the bomber of a commuter train. A mission he has only 8 minutes to complete."
Stalker,1979,8.2,,"Stalker is a philosophical art movie and aesthetic masterpiece, based on ""Roadside Picnic"".","Near a gray and unnamed city is the Zone, an alien place guarded by barbed wire and soldiers. Over his wife's objections, a man rises in the early morning and leaves her with their disabled daughter to meet two men. He's a Stalker, one of a handful who have the mental gifts (and who risk imprisonment) to lead people into the Zone to the Room, a place where one's secret hopes come true."
Strange Days,1995,7.2,"action, police, thriller","Borrowing copiously from cyperpunk but giving things enough spin to keep them interesting, ""Strange Days"" gives an orginal sci-fi version of the old washed-up-cop turns soft-hearted criminal. Set in the futuristic year of 1999, during new years eve, the main character has to solve a case in which he unwittingly finds himself, if he wants to survive the night. The movie also contains music performance by Juliette Lewis and the band Skunk Anansie.","A former cop turned street-hustler accidentally uncovers a conspiracy in Los Angeles in 1999."
Sunshine,2007,7.3,"space, action","This is a pretty good movie. The science is ridiculous, but the characters are great and the CGI is fantastic. At points, chilling.","A team of international astronauts is sent on a dangerous mission to reignite the dying Sun with a nuclear fission bomb in 2057."
Tenet,2020,7.3,"time travel, action, thriller","A great watch for those who like complex movies that you probably have to watch several times to understand everything.","Armed with only the word ""Tenet,"" and fighting for the survival of the entire world, CIA operative, The Protagonist, journeys through a twilight world of international espionage on a global mission that unfolds beyond real time."
The City of Lost Children,1995,7.7,,,"A scientist in a surrealist society kidnaps children to steal their dreams, hoping that they slow his aging process."
The Fifth Element,1997,7.6,"space, action","This movie is ridiculous. Worth watching just for the amazing opera scene - the 'science' in 'science fiction' isn't really worth it, though.","In the colorful future, a cab driver unwittingly becomes the central figure in the search for a legendary cosmic weapon to keep Evil and Mr Zorg at bay."
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,2005,6.8,"adventure, comedy","Pretty much like the first book of the trilogy of five books with the same name, with some Holywood adaptations. (Why, Hollywood?). Very funny and enjoyable.","Mere seconds before the Earth is to be demolished by an alien construction crew, journeyman Arthur Dent is swept off the planet by his friend Ford Prefect, a researcher penning a new edition of ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy."""
The Island,2005,6.9,action,"I rather liked this film; Steve Buscemi's acting abilities brings a poorly-written character above and beyond what I would have thought possible, and Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johanssen were perfectly cast. This was a solid film.","Lincoln Six-Echo is a resident of a seemingly Utopian but contained facility in the year 2019. Like all of the inhabitants of this carefully controlled environment, Lincoln hopes to be chosen to go to the ""The Island"" - reportedly the last uncontaminated spot on the planet. But Lincoln soon discovers that everything about his existence is a lie. He and all of the other inhabitants of the facility are actually human clones. Lincoln makes a daring escape with a beautiful fellow resident named Jordan Two-Delta. Relentlessly pursued by the forces of the sinister institute that once housed them, Lincoln and Jordan engage in a race for their lives to literally meet their makers."
The Man from Earth,2007,8.0,,,"An impromptu goodbye party for Professor John Oldman becomes a mysterious interrogation after the retiring scholar reveals to his colleagues he never ages and has walked the earth for 14,000 years."
The Martian,2015,8.2,,"This is a fairly accurate representation of the awesome book, but it focuses much more on Watney's personality than on the science (which is a given, as we can actually see Watney in this, as opposed to just read his logs in the book). The space shots were incredibly well done, and one scene with a ribbon like an umbilical chord floating in zero g - absolutely beautiful. This film had great actors, marvelously cast. And there's even a reference to Glorfindel at the council of Elrond; I don't think I've laughed that hard in a theatre in years. Loved it.","During a manned mission to Mars, Astronaut Mark Watney is presumed dead after a fierce storm and left behind by his crew. But Watney has survived and finds himself stranded and alone on the hostile planet. With only meager supplies, he must draw upon his ingenuity, wit and spirit to subsist and find a way to signal to Earth that he is alive."
The Matrix,1999,8.7,"ai, action, apocalypse, singularity","One of the most well known scifi films, this is a great expose on what people thought of hackers in the late 90s. The first in a trilogy, this film stands on its own legs, for its well-written script, great casting, and solid score. The unworldly choreography combined with slow motion filming was so influential it is now a cliché.","A computer hacker learns from mysterious rebels about the true nature of his reality and his role in the war against its controllers."
The Signal,2014,6.2,,,"On a road trip, Nic and two friends are drawn to an isolated area by a computer genius. When everything suddenly goes dark, Nic regains consciousness - only to find himself in a waking nightmare."
The Thirteenth Floor,1999,7.0,"thriller, ai","It's a classic, came out the same year of the matrix but is focused on the interactions between the real world and the virtual, no slow motion gun fights here.","Computer scientist Hannon Fuller has discovered something extremely important. He's about to tell the discovery to his colleague, Douglas Hall, but knowing someone is after him, the old man leaves a letter in the computer generated parallel world his company has created (which looks like the 30's with seemingly real people with real emotions). Fuller is murdered in our real world the same night, and his colleague is suspected. Douglas discovers a bloody shirt in his bathroom and he cannot recall what he was doing the night Fuller was murdered. He logs into the system in order to find the letter, but has to confront the unexpected. The truth is harsher than he could ever imagine..."
The Time Machine,2002,4.2,"remake, steampunk","It is an entertaining and a well done movie with lots of scifi topics: time travels, artificial intelligence, a post apocalyptic world with a new race of humans and more.","Hoping to alter the events of the past, a 19th century inventor instead travels 800,000 years into the future, where he finds humankind divided into two warring races."
Transcendence,2014,6.3,ai,"A love story between a woman and her husband uploaded into a computer. What makes the movie a bit scary is that, although a bit unrealistic, it is placed in a near future.","A scientist's drive for artificial intelligence, takes on dangerous implications when his consciousness is uploaded into one such program."
Twelve Monkeys,1996,8.1,"time travel, action",,"In a future world devastated by disease, a convict is sent back in time to gather information about the man-made virus that wiped out most of the human population on the planet."
Vanilla Sky,2001,6.9,"drama, romance","This is an early version of [Inception](#inception) in a lot of ways, and a remake of Possible Worlds in others. While the acting isn't spectactular (notably Tom Cruise's), what is interesting is the myriad level of interpretations of the film and possibly realities involved. The budget ensured that the actual plot was well done, as opposed to just a poor implementation of possible world ideas.","A self-indulgent and vain publishing magnate finds his privileged life upended after a vehicular accident with a resentful lover."
Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,1982,7.7,,"This is a classic film, and well worth watching if only for the incredible and iconic 'khaaaaan' echo. More impressive, however, is Ricardo Montalban's performance, which is incredible on its own. As well, in a move that goes against mainstream whitewashing, a Mexican and not a Caucasian plays a genetically engineered superhuman, making this a movie that showed the power of diversity well ahead of its time. This movie is great to watch.","With the assistance of the Enterprise crew, Admiral Kirk must stop an old nemesis, Khan Noonien Singh, from using his son's life-generating device, the Genesis Device, as the ultimate weapon."
Babylon 5,1994–1998,8.2,"action, adventure, drama","Babylon 5's special effects left a lot to be desired, but the plot was amazing.","A space station in neutral territory is the focus of a unique five year saga."
Battlestar Galactica,2004–2009,8.8,"action, adventure, drama","This show. Watch this show. It's military science fiction done right. The interpersonal relationships are the best part, and the constant questioning of what it means to be human. At times it is a bit heavy handed. At other times it paints humanity as a desperate and stupid species, but at least it does so faithfully and self-referentially. The show is written tremendously well. Gaius Baltar, in particular, is a character worth watching out for. Be warned: once you start, you can't really stop. Portlandia even made a skit about needing [one more episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYjLrJRuMnY).","When an old enemy, the Cylons, resurfaces and obliterate the 12 colonies, the crew of the aged Galactica protects a small civilian fleet - the last of humanity - as they journey toward the fabled 13th colony of Earth."
Black Mirror,2011–,8.8,"drama, thriller",,"A television anthology series that shows the dark side of life and technology."
Blakes 7,1978–1981,8.0,"adventure, drama",,"A group of convicts and outcasts fight a guerrilla war against the totalitarian Terran Federation from a highly advanced alien spaceship."
Children of Dune,2003,7.7,"adventure, drama, fantasy","James McAvoy's acting as Leto II is absolutely incredible in this short series, as is Susan Sarandon's as Princess Corrinno. This miniseries is short and sweet, and manages to make the most out of what really is one of the lesser of the Dune book series.","The twins of Paul ""Muad'dib"" Atreides become embroiled in the political landscape of Arrakis (""Dune"") and the rest of the universe."
Continuum,2012–2015,7.8,"action, thriller",,"A detective from the year 2077 finds herself trapped in present day Vancouver and searching for ruthless criminals from the future."
Doctor Who,1964-1989 / 2005–,8.9,"adventure, drama, family",,"The further adventures of the time traveling alien adventurer and his companions."
Dune,2000,7.1,"adventure, drama, fantasy","Out of all--big or small screen--Dune adaptations, I felt this one has come closest to Herbert's vision. They didn't go too crazy on the CGI either, in that it didn't distract from the story. The acting was a bit meh, but that's usually a question of budget (wasn't HBO... :wink:). Given the dearth of good SF on TV, I would consider it awesome by comparison.","A three-part miniseries on politics, betrayal, lust, greed and the coming of a Messiah. Based on Frank Herbert's classic science fiction novel."
Eureka,2006-2012,7.9,"adventure, drama, family","It is all about a fictional town called Eureka. Inhabitants are geniuses and scientists. This is where the most major technology inventions in the last five decades did happen. Very enjoyable and entertaining show. Most of the episodes were keeping me guessing 'what will happen next?' and 'how this all will end?'.","A U.S. Marshall becomes the sheriff of a remote cozy little Northwestern town of Eureka where the best minds in the US have secretly been tucked away to build futuristic inventions for the government which often go disastrously wrong."
Farscape,1999–2003,8.4,"adventure, drama",,"Thrown into a distant part of the universe, an Earth astronaut finds himself part of a fugitive alien starship crew."
Firefly,2002–2003,9.2,"adventure, drama, western","Asking someone if they wish Firefly would be rebooted tells me everything I need to know about a person. It's in my opinion the best scifi TV-show ever made.","Five hundred years in the future, a renegade crew aboard a small spacecraft tries to survive as they travel the unknown parts of the galaxy and evade warring factions as well as authority agents out to get them."

The first and second season were absolutely mesmerizing and compelling. The character development, the story, the plot twists; all amazing! Literally, pulled a few all-nighters because I had to know what happened next in the series. The premise of the show is after evacuating Earth do to global nuclear bombings and radiation, the International Space Station decide to send '100' of the stations adolescent deliquents down to earth so see if it is habitable again.
